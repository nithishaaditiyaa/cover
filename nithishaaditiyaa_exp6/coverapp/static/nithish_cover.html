            This book Data structures and algorithms (DSA) are fundamental concepts in computer science used for efficient data management and problem-solving.
            <br>
            <br>
            Python, known for its clear and readable syntax, is an excellent language for implementing and learning DSA, offering both built-in structures and the ability to implement user-defined ones.
